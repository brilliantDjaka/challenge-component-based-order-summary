- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Component Based

### What I learned

I learn using component based style in this solution. As much as possible, If \<div\> can be a component instead a single HTML. I will convert that into separate component.

Maybe the code / file structure is wrong. But, I think the concept of component based is not wrong.

Like this :

```html
<div class="container">
  <Title>
      Order Summary
  </Title>
  <Description/>
  <MusicCard/>
  <ButtonProceed/>
  <div class="cancel">Cancel Order</div>
</div>
```

### Continued development

I found that component based model is very useful for code readablity and organizing / separating code. I will use that technique in future
